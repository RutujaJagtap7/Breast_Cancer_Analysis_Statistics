# Breast_Cancer_Analysis_Statistics

In this report, we will conduct a comprehensive analysis of the BreastCancer dataset, focusing on the distinctive
characteristics of breast tissue samples collected from a cohort of 699 women. The dataset encapsulates
valuable information that can shed light on various aspects of breast health and provide insights into the
features associated with tissue samples. Each sample has nine easily assessed cytological characteristics that
were measured. These characteristics are measured on a scale from 1 to 10, with a lower number indicating
healthier cells for that specific characteristic, and a higher number indicating less healthy or unhealthy cells.
There is a response column in the dataset that shows historic examination values indicating whether the
sample was benign or malignant.
